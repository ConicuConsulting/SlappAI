### **1. Define Key Focus Areas**
To avoid getting overwhelmed, break the bot’s functionality into distinct focus areas:
1. **Move Prioritization**:
   - **Current**: Static priority based on phases and weights.
   - **Goal**: Refine the logic for each phase dynamically (opening, midgame, endgame).
2. **Heuristic Scoring**:
   - **Current**: Basic scoring using piece values and decay for repeated moves.
   - **Goal**: Add more nuanced heuristics (e.g., piece mobility, king safety, pawn structure).
3. **Game Phase Detection**:
   - **Current**: Simple detection based on the number of moves or pieces.
   - **Goal**: Make phase detection more robust (e.g., detect transitions based on board state).
4. **Logging and Analysis**:
   - **Current**: Basic debug logs.
   - **Goal**: Log move prioritization details and decisions for post-game analysis.
5. **Self-Learning (Future)**:
   - **Goal**: Implement a training loop for continuous improvement (e.g., adjust weights dynamically).

### **2. Develop a Progress Tracker (Markdown Example)**

#### **Chess Bot Progress Tracker**

##### **1. Move Prioritization**
| Feature                        | Status       | Notes / Next Steps                          |
|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Checkmate detection            | Implemented  | Works well; ensure it's prioritized.       |
| Captures                       | Partially Done | Refine scoring for high-value captures.   |
| Central control                | Basic        | Add higher weights in the opening phase.   |
| Development (knights, bishops) | Basic        | Prioritize early-game development further. |

##### **2. Heuristic Scoring**
| Feature                  | Status       | Notes / Next Steps                         |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Piece values             | Implemented  | Works well; ensure scaling is appropriate.|
| Piece mobility           | Missing      | Evaluate potential moves per piece.       |
| King safety              | Basic        | Add scoring for protecting own king.      |
| Pawn structure           | Missing      | Penalize isolated or backward pawns.      |

##### **3. Game Phase Detection**
| Feature             | Status       | Notes / Next Steps                          |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Basic detection     | Implemented  | Refine thresholds for phase transitions.   |
| Transition triggers | Missing      | Add logic based on piece activity/state.   |

##### **4. Logging and Analysis**
| Feature                 | Status       | Notes / Next Steps                          |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Debug logs              | Basic        | Add phase-specific and prioritization logs.|
| Move analysis logs      | Missing      | Log all evaluated moves and scores.        |
| Post-game strategy logs | Missing      | Save logs for analyzing and refining weights.|

### **3. Create a Flowchart**
A flowchart can visually represent the bot’s workflow and focus areas for improvement.

  |
  v

End
```

### **4. Tactical Iterative Focus**
For each iteration, we can pick one focus area or feature to refine. For example:
- **Iteration 1**: Refine move prioritization (e.g., add better heuristics for central control).
- **Iteration 2**: Enhance game phase detection to handle transitions dynamically.
- **Iteration 3**: Improve logging to include details about each decision.
- **Iteration 4**: Integrate a self-learning loop.

---

### **5. Action Plan for Next Steps**
1. **Start with move prioritization**:
   - Refine the logic for capturing high-value pieces.
   - Ensure central control is emphasized in the opening.
   - Add scoring for piece development in the opening phase.
2. **Refine phase detection**:
   - Use thresholds based on board state and activity rather than just piece count.
3. **Enhance logs**:
   - Add detailed logs to track move prioritization and decisions.
   - Use these logs to analyze performance after games.
